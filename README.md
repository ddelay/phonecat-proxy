# phonecat-proxy

A simple Node.js proxy server.  This project demonstrates a pattern
for combining a modern, client-side application framework (in this case
AngularJS) with Domino data.  Although this project assumes AngularJS,
the same pattern can be used with other client-side frameworks.

## Requirements

- A Domino server running the HTTP task.  This server must have the Domino data
API enabled.
- Node.js and npm.
- An instance of [angular-phonecat](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat).
This is a simple Node.js project meant to demonstrate AngularJS.  If you haven't
already done so, install [angular-phonecat](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat) 
first.
